/*
    SMIT can be imagined as a 2d matrix with dimentions (N*M)
    This is the time when new students comes to SMIT.
    So the management of SMIT decided to distrubute sweets to certain parts of the campus denoted by submatrix
    Aaditya suggested Q submatrix to them.


    For each suggestion you are given (l1,r1)  and (l2,r2) which denotes the left top and the right bottom of the submatrix.
    You are also given a number K. You need to distribute K sweets equally among all the cells of the submatrix.

    After distributions our HOD wanted to know the total number of sweets alloted in a submatrix (x1,y1),(x2,y2);

    So, you need to help the HOD and print the total number of sweets alloted to submatrix (x1,y1),(x2,y2);
